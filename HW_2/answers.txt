question 1:
our main function in four of the five c files is exactly the same, because we get the arguments in each file in the same way,
so we could write only a one c code (one file) instead of this four and a four functions (min, max, mean, median) and call all of this functions in the main function and get the same results.

question 2:
the grades that we have got are uniformly divided, and we can check this by using the median function that we have written.
the median that we have got was always close to 50, so we can conclude from this that the grades are uniformly divided into two intervals [0,50] and [51,100].
